# Ex. No: 17E - Adjacency List Representation of a Graph

## AIM:
To write a Python program to demonstrate the **adjacency list representation** of the given graph.

---

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Start the program.

**Step 2**: Define a class `AdjNode` to create a node for each adjacent vertex:
- Store the **vertex number**.
- Store the **link to the next adjacent node**.

**Step 3**: Define a class `Graph` to create the graph using adjacency lists:
- Initialize the **number of vertices**.
- Create a **list (array)** of size `V`, where each element is initially `None`.

**Step 4**: Define a method `add_edge(src, dest)` to:
- Add `dest` to the adjacency list of `src`.
- Add `src` to the adjacency list of `dest` (for **undirected graphs**).

**Step 5**: Define a method `print_graph()` to:
- Traverse the adjacency list of each vertex.
- Print the **vertex** and its **adjacent nodes**.

**Step 6**: In the main program:
- Create a `Graph` object with `V` vertices.
- Call `add_edge()` for all desired edges.
- Call `print_graph()` to display the adjacency list.

**Step 7**: End the program.
